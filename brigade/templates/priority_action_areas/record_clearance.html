      <h2>About this Priority Action Area</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="width-seven-twelfths">
      <p>Brigade members across the country have been working to create pathways to record clearance for years, building momentum for this work via <a href="https://c4a.me/slack" target="_blank">the #clean-slate Slack channel</a>, and weekly  clean slate calls. In 2019, Code for America Brigade members launched the Record Clearance Research Team with the goal of conducting research on fines and fees associated with record clearance, and <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-of-civic-hacking-2019" target="_blank">2019’s NDoCH focus</a> was on the record clearance process. We partnered with Code for America’s Criminal Justice team on these efforts.</p>

      <p>We want to continue to make an impact in this space, whether it is in the area of fines and fees or helping local government identify records that are eligible for clearance. Connect with the work of Brigades on <a href="https://discourse.codeforamerica.org/t/priority-action-area-creating-pathways-to-record-clearance/729" target="_blank">Creating Pathways to Record Clearance on Discourse</a>.</p>
