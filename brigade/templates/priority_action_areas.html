    <div class="width-one-half">
      <p>Priority Action Areas are four project areas where the Network feels we can have outsized impact in 2020. It is where we will focus shared projects and resources via our distributed Brigades across the country, making it possible for projects to impact several places at once. Resources like toolkits, workshops, and project management assistance will be provided to Brigades by the Network Team to support collective work in these four prioritized areas.</p>

    <div class="width-seven-twelfths">
      <p>Priority Action Areas were created in response to Brigade members and leaders asking for more project support, ideas and tools for projects that have impact, and more cross-brigade collaboration on projects. They were chosen in a process where the Network voiced their feedback on what areas they were most excited to tackle in 2020 via surveys, Discourse, workshops, and conversations. The National Advisory Council then narrowed down this feedback into the top three most popular, and viable topics. After finalizing our selections, the NAC then decided to add Rapid Response as a Priority Action Area to meet the needs of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evident energy around that topic within the Network.</p>
