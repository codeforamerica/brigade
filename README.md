How do users interact with system?
----------------------------------
As a user:

1. I want to help with a specific app, show me all the deployed versions.
2. I want to help out in my city, show me all the deployed apps in my city.
3. I belong to a brigade already, show me the deployed apps they are working on.
4. I want to deploy a new app in my city, show me what has been deployed and what has not.

Project Jargon
--------------
- user - civic hacker (developers, designers, etc)
- brigade - group of users
- app - code that already exists (http://marketplace.civiccommons.org/). Users will choose an app from the application and deploy it locally as needed. Refers to an existing github project. These will be prededfined by CFM staff.
  * For example: An app was created in Boston to track fire hydrants due to the possiblity of them being covered by snow during bad storms. This code base is already publically available. A group of civic hackers could come in and claim the app to deploy locally (ie - Norfolk to use app for identifying fire hydrants but identifying something else).

Goals of project
----------------
User Can:

- find a project they want to work on
- commit to the project
- provide a description of their skill set
- receive all the info of stuff they need to do (project checklist)
- issue a challenge for something an existing app might not necessarily address

Rules
-----
- users can deploy or work on whatever they want (it is voluntary after all)
- members of a brigade are not required to be in the location of the project

Future Ideas
------------
- brigades may have moderation in the future

## <a name="issues"></a>Submitting an Issue
We use the [GitHub issue tracker][issues] to track bugs and features. Before
submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't
already been submitted. You can indicate support for an existing issue by
voting it up. When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist][] that
includes a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce the
bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system. Ideally, a
bug report should include a pull request with failing specs.

[gist]: https://gist.github.com/

## <a name="pulls"></a>Submitting a Pull Request
1. Fork the project.
2. Create a topic branch.
3. Implement your feature or bug fix.
4. Add tests for your feature or bug fix.
5. Run `bundle exec rake test`. If your changes are not 100% covered, go back
   to step 4.
6. Commit and push your changes.
7. Submit a pull request. Please do not include changes to the gemspec or
   version file. (If you want to create your own version for some reason,
   please do so in a separate commit.)

## <a name="versions"></a>Supported Ruby Versions
This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby
implementations:

* Ruby 1.9.2
* Ruby 1.9.3


If something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it should be considered
a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the versions listed
above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a
timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the
time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
