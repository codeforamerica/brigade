                        <h3>Transparency:</h3> Open governments ensure accountability and informed civic participation by conducting their operations and making decisions more openly, and publishing their information for the public to see.

                        <h3>Participation:</h3> Open governments leverage technology to make public information accessible and create innovative tools to engage citizens in government decision-making. Open governments promote collaboration by encouraging city departments to share information and engage citizens.

                        <h3>Accessibility:</h3> Open governments not only make sure public information is shared, but that anyone can find, access and use it.

                        <h3>Efficiency:</h3> Open governments enable programmers, journalists, non-profits, and community activists to develop valuable civic tools powered by public data which help government better serve the public.

                        often don’t have the time to attend public forums; traditional feedback
                        techniques gather opinions that don’t represent the whole community. Technology
                        changes this reality. Check out these three engagement tools you can use

                        <a href="http://nycopendata.pediacities.com/wiki/index.php/NYC_Open_Data">wiki </a>allowed the public to see the proposed policy and offer edits and tips.
                        It was used in tandem with a policy unconference to ensure the city got
                        citizen feedback before adopting the standards and guidelines.</p>

            <h3 class="impact">The Benefits of Open Data</h3>
            <p>Governments collect data on taxes, health services, education, and much
                more. While government officials and employees have access to this information,
                the general public often does not. Opening this data to public use by publishing
                it online in a standardized format brings benefits to public servants and
                constituents alike. Benefits such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Government departments avoid wasting time and resources handling requests
                        for information on an individual basis.</li>
                    <li>Opening data allows other city departments to make use of previously unshared
                        information -- and creates new opportunities for collaboration.</li>
                    <li>Open data improves government transparency and increases public trust;
                        a survey by the open data company Socrata found that 56% of citizens report
                        that they would

                    <li>Civic hackers, journalists, non-profits, and even businesses can use the
                        data to build websites and applications for public use, such as:
                        <a href="http://pubadvocate.nyc.gov/landlord-watchlist">The Landlord Watchlist</a>(New York),
                        <a href="http://civiccommons.org/apps/sweeparoundus">SweepAround.us</a>(Chicago)

                </ul>Don't forget to spread the word about the benefits of open data and open
                government to your colleagues. To get the conversation started, the Open
                Impact campaign created a handout that you can share with fellow public
                servants. Download it.
                <h2>Liberate Department Data</h2>
                <p>Opening data takes four basic steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the data you want to release</li>
                    <li>Apply an open license</li>
                    <li>Making the data available</li>
                    <li>Publicize it</li>
                </ol>The Open Knowledge Foundation has created a
                <a href="http://opendatahandbook.org/en/">comprehensive guide</a>to the process -- and it’s in plain English so that anyone (techie or
                not) can understand.
                <h2>Create an Open Data Portal</h2>
                <p>If you’re the head of a department, or can get your department leader
                    onboard, consider making an open data portal for your department (or, even
                    better, your city!). An open data portal brings all the datasets for a
                    department together in one centralized place that is easy to find accessible
                    by all. This makes it easy for constituents, developers, and other departments

        <div id="procurement"
        class="collapse in drop-content">
            <p>City governments across the United States spend billions of dollars each
                year procuring products and services for their cities. Systems for attracting
                vendors and accepting proposals, however, are often confusing, cumbersome,
                and slow. This can deter new vendors and companies from competing for government
                business, which causes the city and its citizens to lose out.</p>
            <p>To ensure those with the best-fit solutions vie for a city’s business,
                we’ve identified six ways you can leverage technology to improve your procurement
                process:</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Create a centralized website listing all RFP, RFQ, RFI opportunities</strong>
                <em>CHALLENGE:</em>When procurement requests are dispersed across departments
                and websites, it is difficult for new vendors to find out what opportunities
                are available.
                <em>ACTION:</em>Centralize RFP, RFQ, and RFIs on a website that is easy to
                find and linked through the city website’s homepage. The website should
                allow the user the ability to search opportunities by keyword, as well
                as sort by relevant category.
                <em>WHY:</em>By creating a central, easy-to-navigate website where vendors
                can find information, you’ll help those who want and need information,
                find it.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Provide data feed or well-formed HTML versions of RFP, RFQ, and RFI opportunities</strong>
                <em>CHALLENGE:</em>When officials scan RFP, RFQ, or RFIs and upload them as
                PDFs, it's almost impossible for developers to work with the information.
                <em>ACTION:</em>Provide proposals in well-formed HTML or create a data feed
                listing all RFP, RFQ, and RFI opportunities.
                <em>WHY:</em>By making it easier for developers to work with RFP, RFQ, and
                RFI data, you open the door for the creation of apps and software platforms
                that can improve the procurement process for the city or the vendors.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Create an online portal for vendors to submit RFP, RFQ, and RFI materials</strong>
                <em>CHALLENGE:</em>To submit a RFP, RFQ, or RFI, a vendor typically has to
                complete multiple steps and fill out numerous, lengthy forms.
                <em>ACTION:</em>Create a vendor portal to provide a centralized hub for all
                completed submission documents.
                <em>WHY:</em>Allowing vendors to submit materials online cuts down on the
                time the city spends processing proposals. This frees up your department
                to spend more time on other things, like marketing and outreach. The portal
                also helps the vendor track progress and makes it easier for them to identify
                missing materials.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Create a content management system to track and review submissions</strong>
                <em>CHALLENGE:</em>Multiple parties must review RFP, RFQ, and RFI submissions.
                When submissions aren’t centralized or consistently tracked, it can be
                difficult to understand what stage each submission is in the review process.
                This can significantly increase the time it takes to decide on a vendor.
                <em>ACTION:</em>Create a content management system to track and review submissions.
                <em>WHY:</em>Having a content management system to help you track proposals
                allows you to streamline the review process. This allows you to more quickly
                come to a decision on a vendor.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Use technology and social media to get the word out to bidders</strong>
                <em>CHALLENGE:</em>It can be difficult for vendors who haven’t sold services
                and products to the city before to identify when opportunities they are
                qualified for become available.
                <em>ACTION:</em>Use social media, online forums, and targeted internet ads
                to get the word out to interested parties about active requests. For example,
                use social media like Facebook and Twitter to blast out the word when the
                request is active. Use YouTube or Vimeo to make a video that describes
                the request and what an ideal product or service would offer.
                <em>WHY:</em>By using a variety of channels to advertise, you can reach a
                broader audience. This can diversify and increase the products and services
                to choose from.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Develop an intranet with template proposals and a catalogue of past proposals</strong>
                <em>CHALLENGE:</em>Drafting RFP, RFQ, and RFIs requires a lot of resources.
                Employees writing requests could benefit from up-to-date boilerplate templates,
                as well as from access to similar past requests.
                <em>ACTION:</em>Create a central intranet for RFP, RFQ, RFI templates and
                update regularly as procurement policies change. Include a catalogue of
                past proposals.
                <em>WHY:</em>Employees writing request documents should be armed with an up-to-date
                template that gives them a starting point to create a proposal, as well
                as access to similar proposals written in the past. This will allow them
                to focus on defining the nuances of each request to make sure it elicits
                the most effective responses.</p>

                <p>Open government policies lay the framework for building a culture of innovation
                    and openness from the ground up.</p>
                <h2>The Benefits of Open Government Policies</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>They catalyze civic innovation and increase transparency</strong>Open
                    data policies give civic hackers reassurance that they can rely on city
                    data and allow them to build service organizations, businesses, and product
                    models around this data. Open data policies also provide transparency and
                    give citizens, city departments, and city officials equal access to data.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>They offer economic and security benefits</strong>Open source solutions
                    can save cities money on licensing and redistribution costs. Open source
                    solutions can also offer a greater level of security to cities because
                    they are patrolled by a variety of users. The Department of Defense, Google,
                    Facebook, and the White House (to name a few) all have open source policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>They ensure greater interoperability, and the ability of systems to work
                        together</strong>When you can plug in new software or systems to existing
                    ones, it cuts down on costs, inefficiency, and headaches!</p>
                <h2>Sample Policies</h2>
                <p>Use these templates and guides to get started drafting open policies for
                    your city. The open government directive is a good place to begin. If you’re
                    city is looking to be more ambitious, Open Impact has provided editable,
                    working documents for an open government resolution and bill. We are excited
                    to collaborate with governments and the public on these model pieces of
                    legislation, so feel free to give feedback.</p>

                <h4>Open government policies include:</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Open Data and Open Standards Language</strong>The open data policy requires
                    departments to publish their data in machine-readable formats and make
                    it available to the public-at-large through a single web portal. It also
                    requires the city to develop open data technical standards, a compliance
                    plan detailing qualifying data, and a timeline to make the data publicly
                    available. This policy also outlines open standards regulations for data.
                    <strong>Public Records Act</strong>The Public Records Act requires city agencies
                    to publish their records publicly online through a single web portal maintained
                    by the city.
                    <strong>Open Source Procurement Policy</strong>The open source procurement policy
                    requires agencies to consider open source software when acquiring software.
                    It also requires them to catalogue and share software source code that
                    facilitates the code’s reuse and meets set definitions.</p>

                <p>The Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics — initially conceived in
                    <a href="http://newurbanmechanics.org/"> Boston </a>and now being replicated in cities across the country — is an organizational
                    model that helps cities innovate by aggregating risk, building partnerships,
                    and encouraging experimentation in government. Projects have ranged from
                    crowdsourcing development of sensor-driven apps to government-to-government
                    resource sharing. This process for civic innovation is one that can adapted
                    by any city. By creating an Office of New Urban Mechanics in your city
                    you can institutionalize a commitment to innovation.
