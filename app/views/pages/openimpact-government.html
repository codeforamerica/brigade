                        Open government is a global movement to bring government into the digital age by making public data open by default and creating new opportunities for civic engagement using the web as a platform.

                        I pledge to support the following principles of open government:

                        <h3>Transparency:</h3> Open governments ensure accountability and informed civic participation by conducting their operations and making decisions more openly, and publishing their information for the public to see.

                        <h3>Participation:</h3> Open governments leverage technology to make public information accessible and create innovative tools to engage citizens in government decision making. Open governments promote collaboration by encouraging city departments to share information and engage citizens.

                        <h3>Accessibility:</h3> Open governments not only make sure public information is shared, but that anyone can find, access and use it.

                        <h3>Efficiency:</h3> Open governments enable programmers, journalists, non-profits, and community activists to develop valuable civic tools powered by public data, which helps government better serve the public.

            <p>Governments collect data on taxes, health services, education, and much

                <p>To open data, take these four basic steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the data you want to release</li>
                    <li>Apply an open license</li>
                    <li>Making the data available</li>
                    <li>Publicize it</li>
                </ol> <p>To take these four steps, check out the Open Knowledge Foundation's comprehensive guide to the process. It’s in plain English so that anyone (techie or not) can understand.

                <h3>Create an Open Data Portal</h3>
                <p>If you’re the head of a department, or can get your department leader
                    onboard, make an open data portal for your department (or, even
                    better, your city!). An open data portal brings all the datasets for a
                    department (or city) together in one centralized place that is accessible
                    to all. This makes it easy for constituents, developers, and other departments
                    to search for the information they need. Data portals are already in use
                    across the United States by 34 states and 15 cities from large (New York:

                <h3>Open government policies include:</h3>
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Open Data and Open Standards Language</strong></li>
                    <p>The open data policy requires
                    departments to publish their data in machine-readable formats and make
                    it available to the public-at-large through a single web portal. It also
                    requires the city to develop open data technical standards, a compliance
                    plan detailing qualifying data, and a timeline to make the data publicly
                    available. This policy also outlines open standards regulations for data.</p>
                <li><strong>Public Records Act</strong></li>
                    <p> The Public Records Act requires city agencies
                    to publish their records publicly online through a single web portal maintained
                    by the city.</p>
                <li><strong>Open Source Procurement Policy</strong></li><p> The open source procurement policy
                    requires agencies to consider open source software when acquiring software.
                    It also requires them to catalogue and share software source code that
                    facilitates the code’s reuse and meets set definitions.</p>

            <p> City governments spend billions of dollars each year procuring products and services but systems for attracting vendors and accepting proposals can be confusing, cumbersome, and slow. This can deter new vendors and companies from competing for government business, which causes the city and its citizens to lose out.</p>

                    <a href="http://newurbanmechanics.org/"> Boston </a>and now being replicated in cities across the country — is an organizational
                    model that helps cities innovate by aggregating risk, building partnerships,
                    and encouraging experimentation in government. Projects have ranged from
                    crowdsourcing development of sensor-driven apps to government-to-government
                    resource sharing. This process for civic innovation is one that can adapted
                    by any city. By creating an Office of New Urban Mechanics in your city
                    you can institutionalize a commitment to innovation.
