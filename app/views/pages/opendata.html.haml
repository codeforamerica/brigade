      %h1 Liberate civic data and build civic digital libraries!
%p Open government data increases trust in government, reduces friction in processes, and leads to economic development through new technologies and companies.
%p Civic data does not free itself. It needs you to liberate it.

%p Civic data informs important things like your commute, where you buy a house, how your city spends money, and what's happening in your city. But most civic data is consistently inaccessible to the public online without added cost. And the public now includes developers who want to use civic data to deliver software that improves interfaces to government.
