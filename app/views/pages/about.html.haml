%a{:name => "local"}
%h2.pages Local Identity
%p We think your local identity is important and we want you to maintain and celebrate it. At the same time, we recognize the power of a strong brand that is linked to a strong national network. Feel free to call your local brigade whatever you want. You’ll make links to our platform, use our tag lines, and other resources that will identify your affiliation as a CfA Brigade.

%p To keep things simple and establish a pattern, we default new Brigades to "Code for [LOCATION] Brigade" where [LOCATION] is a city, region, town, state or whatever else makes sense to the local organizers

%p There are a bunch of other groups that are also Brigades that follow the "Open [LOCATION]" pattern. That's cool, too.

%h3 “Powered by Brigade”
%p We want to support local communities of practice who want to be “Powered by Brigade.” This tag line symbolizes your affiliation and commitment to our mission and goals. Local communities of practices that are “Powered by Brigade” enjoy the following benefits:
%ul.pages
  %li Affiliation with a strong, reputable brand for civic technology
  %li Connection to a strong, national network for civic technology
  %li Features on one or more of our web properties
  %li Assistance from our support team
  %li Resources for events
  %li Resources for hosting
  %li Invitation to our annual summit
