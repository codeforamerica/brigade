                Here's a chance to code for America where you live by contributing to an open source, civic project.
              %p.small
                Join us for the Great American Civic Hack: a three month campaign to take our favorite open source, civic repos to the next level; to close issues, reach milestones and generally make code fork and merge ready. <span class="mini-icon  mini-icon-public-fork"></span> <span class="mini-icon  mini-icon-pull-request"></span>

                Let's rally together this summer for better open source, civic software! Empty issues lists. Submit and merge pull requests. Make code easier to re-use. Let's see what we can code together.

              %p.small
                The Great American Civic Hack is a three month campaign in two stages:
              %ul.small{:style => "padding-left:10px;"}
                %li
                  Stage 1 (May 2013): Repo nomination and voting. Nominations close June 2.
                %li
                  Stage 2 (June 3, 2013 to July 31, 2013): Coding
              %p.small{:style => "padding-top: 20px;"}
                We'll track Stage 2 on GitHub and Drupal.org. All repos that close the issues identified at the beginning of the campaign will receive a Silver Fork Award: Code for America's recognition for civic hacking. Other Silver Fork Awards will be given for:
              %ul.small{:style => "padding-left:10px;"}
                %li
                  Most merged pull requests
                %li
                  Most issues closed
                %li
                  Most contributors
                %li
                  and others
              %p.small
                There's a "National" campaign and "Local" campaign. The national campaign will feature a short list of select repos for national organizing efforts. The local campaign is intended to show off what brigades are working on this summer.
