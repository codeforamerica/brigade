        %p.small
          Let's rally together this summer and whip our collective repos into shape! Let's empty our issues lists, submit & merge some pull requests and make it so anyone anywhere can re-use our code. Let's see what we can code together.

        %h2{:style => "padding-left:10px;"} How it works
        %p.small
          The Great American Civic Hack is a three month campaign with two stages:
        %ul.small{:style => "padding-left:10px;"}
          %li
            Stage 1 (May 2013): Repo nomination & voting
          %li
            Stage 2 (June 1, 2013 to July 31, 2013): Coding
        %p.small{:style => "padding-top: 20px;"}
          The Great American Civic Hack will be tracked on GitHub. All repos that close the issues IDed at the beginning of the campaign will receive a Silver Fork Award: Code for America's recognition for civic hacking. Other Silver Fork Awards will be given for:
