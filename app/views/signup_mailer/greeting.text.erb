Thanks for your interest in a Code for America Brigade in your community.

In the meantime, we’ll keep in touch about opportunities to participate in activities at the national level.

Remember, if you change your mind, you can always come back to sign up to be an organizer and take a more proactive role.

Good luck and we'll be in touch.
