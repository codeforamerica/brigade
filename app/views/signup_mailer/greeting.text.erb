Thanks for your interest in a Code for America Brigade in your community. We’ll let you know if things start picking up in your area. 

In the meantime, we’ll keep in touch about opportunities to participate in activities at the national level.

Remember, if you change your mind, you can always come back to sign up to be an organizer and take a more proactive role. See the toolkit here: http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/tools

Good luck and we'll be in touch ASAP.
