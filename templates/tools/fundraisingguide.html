	<h3>Donations vs. Sponsorships</h3>
 	<p>I’ve heard that Code for America can help intake donations for my local Brigade. Are donations the same as sponsorships?</p>
	 <br>
	 <p><b>Short Answer:</b>No, sponsorships and donations are not the same thing. Code for America can help Captains and Stage 2 leaders intake donations for their Brigade.</p>
	 <p><b>Long Answer:</b> Donations are tax-deductible and cannot have business benefits for the donor (giving) company. Sponsorships are not tax-deductible, require a signed agreement, and include specific deliverables. Code for America can help Captains and Stage 2 leaders intake donations for their Brigade. Your local fundraising will be through donations, not sponsorships. Please clarify this with anyone who wants to provide resources for your Brigade.</p>

	b. The mailing address for Code for America is:<br>
	155 9th Street, San Francisco, CA 94103<br>
	<li>Code for America receives check</li>
	a. The Code for America finance team will receive the check.
	- If under $1,000, full amount will be available for you to spend <br>
	- If over $1,000, please first reach out to the Brigade staff (brigade-info@codefoamerica.org) Code for America to confirm how this will be spent and receive approval in advance.<br>
	<li>Funds will be added to your Brigade account to spend against. Note: these funds will be spent down before drawing against any of your Code for America HQ-approved budget.</li>
	<li>You can access funds by submitting expenses against the funds in Expensify using ths <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RKkjW0YZfysBZ6JiJgV8j7o61H_Sh9y9pUl9fZzI2Bw/edit#heading=h.lfbjsp7i33tk" target=_blank>Support Reinbursement Process.</a></li>
