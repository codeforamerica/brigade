<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>As you learned on the <a href="codeforamerica.org/brigade/about" target=_blank> Brigade About page </a> and <a href="codeforamerica.org/brigade/organize" target=_blank> Brigade Organize page </a>, Brigades are local volunteer groups that bring together community members to help make government work better - and they exist all over the world! No matter their location, Brigades build technology to support local government accountability & civic engagement. </p>

<p><b>This page will dig deeper into all the nuts and bolts you need to know if you are organizing a Brigade in the US or Internationally.</b></p>

 </div>
 
<div class="layout-minim">
<p>You can see where Brigades are already located on the <a href="codeforamerica.org/brigade" target=_blank> Brigade Website Map </a>. It is best to concentrate Brigade work with one central Brigade in each location, although some Brigades participate as Regional Brigades, and invite residents from neighboring cities to participate until that city is ready to have their own Brigade. We can help you figure out what makes sense as you get started. </p>

<p>If you are pretty sure no one is organizing in your area, let's get started!  The first thing you should know is that Brigades can participate as Network Members or Official Chapter; and the distinction is embedded within our organizing structre, the <b>four Ps</b>.  Right now we are going to go into to depth with each P, but you can skip to <a href="#checklist">the checklist</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><b>*Note:</b> US Brigades can join as Official Chapters and Network Members, International Brigades are invited to join as Network Members and can then explore becoming a <a href="codeforall.org/participate" target=_blank>Code for All partner.</a></p>

<h2 id="people">2. People</h2>

<p>We believe <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/04/08/it-has-to-work-for-everyone/" target=_blank>government has to work for everyone; </a> so our aim to get as many people involved so our Brigades are rich with all the different skills sets your entire community has to offer. Afterall, the members of your community are what will power your Brigade - so you should invite everyone to join! </p>
<p>So who is that exactly? Technologists, researchers, public policy enthusiasts, committed residents, city employees,  and everyone in between!</p>

<ol>
<li>You can ensure people's safety by implementing a Code of Conduct; <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct" target=_blank>fork this one!</a></li>	
<li>Next, build a website! Your Brigade needs a landing page so people can find you, plus you need a place where you can point to your Code of Conduct.</li>
-Your website can be something you build, can be a public Facebook or Meetup Account, or a page you fork using <a href="https://github.com/sfbrigade/sfbrigade.github.io" target=_blank>some base code Code for San Francisco made.</a><br>
-You can then use your website to advertise your event schedule...<br>
<li>Start meeting!  Find some space, head to the local library, ask your boss if you can use your office, etc. You should meet at least three times before you apply to become a Network Member, and hosting a CodeAcross or National Day event counts.  If you are an existing group with lots of meetings under your belt that  works, too.</li>
<li>As people start to show up to your meetings (which we call hack nights) you can help folks get more involved by offering <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oEB1CuzCHldxP_bzcvmcrmK0yAE1BzV2AGhtwtYKZVY/edit" target=_blank>Core Team Member roles</a> (the roles in this doc capture the big bucket to-dos of any Brigade, but you can hack the names and add more leadership roles to your squad).  Having Core Team Members helps you delegate responsibilities, and finally get some sleep.</li>	
</ol>

<p><b>*Note:</b>If you complete this step, your ready to become a Network Member, you just need to fill out the  "Join as a Brigade Network Member" form and adhere to the "Participate" activities below.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="participate">3. Participate</h2>

<p>Hearing from you and sharing recent activities with the Code for America network will allow your Brigade to fruitfully grow and sustain. </p>

<ol>
<li>As a Brigade Network Member we will make it easy for you to connect with other organizers through our: </li>
- Brigade Slack Channel<br>
- Brigade Map<br>
- forum.codeforamerica.org<br>
- … and other mediums we use to swap stories, ideas, and plans for global network events, like…
<li>Collective Days of Action are also ways you will participate in the network. Your Brigade will want to participate in at least two collective days of action per year, for example CodeAcross and National Day of Civic Hacking is June 6! Register now!)</li>
<li>Tell us over here at San Francisco’s Headquarters what’s up!  You can fill out this “What’s New with Your Brigade” survey anytime to share a cool new story or project. </li>	
</ol>

<p><b>*Note:</b>Once you have People, fill out the "Join as a Brigade Network form", and Participate in the above channels that we will invite you to, you are a Brigade Network Member.  As your grow you may consider the following two Ps, which allow you to evolve into an Brigade Official Chapter.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="plans">4. Plans</h2>

<p>You know all those ideas that have been circulating at hack night?  We want to help you put those into action! </p>
<ol>
<li>You should use this<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16GO5lnwEBKMFhhvewhKiNUcvVbTw5NtunVxhmCS6vw0/edit#heading=h.yqfbsdykacwf" target=_blank> Strategic Plan Template </a>to outline your goals and consider how you will measure outcomes. </li>
<li>You will also need to orient your plans around the <a href="codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/" target=_blank>Principles for 21st Century Government</a> and the Code for America <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/focus-areas/" target=_blank>Focus Areas;</a> so plan to bucket your goals in the above template around these elements.</li>
<li>Also, within the template you will link to a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ANUIfVr0M3kAFr5F6M-EnJt8dK4fMNRzBELlCfIiyUg/edit#gid=975530202" target=_blank>Budget Tracker </a>which can help us both  plan, monitor, and reimburse your Brigade expenses.</li>

  </div>

<h2 id="partnerships">5. Partnerships</h2>

<p>Since you started organizing, all kinds of folks have probably been encouraging you and mentioning organizations they know of or belong to that would support the work of your Brigade - so you should partner with them!  </p>
<ol>
<li>To become an Official Brigade you will need at least two partnerships in place:</li>
- one with a local community organization (NGOs, school, etc.) that has data, talent, or space to share<br>
Examples: a Community Health clinic with data it can share, the local police department, the local library, a code-teaching organization (like <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/10/13/want-to-take-your-brigade-to-the-next-level-develop-it/" target=_blank> Girl Develop It</a>).<br>
- and another with a  local government employee.<br>  
Examples: Your city's Cheif Data Officer, and employee in the City Manager's Office, a representative of the County Innovation office, etc.
<li>Collaborating with these folks will make it a lot easier to implement that awesome plan of yours, and once your have a few partners you will notice more and more keep rolling in.</li>
</ol>
