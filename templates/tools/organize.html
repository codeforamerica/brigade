<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>As you learned on the <a href="codeforamerica.org/brigade/about" target=_blank> Brigade About page </a> and <a href="codeforamerica.org/brigade/organize" target=_blank> Brigade Organize page </a>, Brigades are local volunteer groups that bring together community members to help make government work better - and they exist all over the world! No matter their location, Brigades build technology to support local government accountability & civic engagement. </p>

<p><b>This page will dig deeper into all the nuts and bolts you need to know if you are organizing a Brigade in the US or Internationally.</b></p>

<p>You can see where Brigades are already located on the <a href="codeforamerica.org/brigade" target=_blank> Brigade Website Map </a>. It is best to concentrate Brigade work with one central Brigade in each location, although some Brigades participate as Regional Brigades, and invite residents from neighboring cities to participate until that city is ready to have their own Brigade. We can help you figure out what makes sense as you get started. </p>

<p>If you are pretty sure no one is organizing in your area, let's get started!  The first thing you should know is that Brigades can participate as Network Members or Official Chapter; and the distinction is embedded within our organizing structre, the <b>four Ps</b>.</p>

<br>
<p><b>*Note:</b> US Brigades can join as Official Chapters and Network Members, International Brigades are invited to join as Network Members and can then explore becoming a <a href="codeforall.org/participate" target=_blank>Code for All partner.</a></p>

<h2 id="people">2. People</h2>

<p>We believe <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/04/08/it-has-to-work-for-everyone/" target=_blank>government has to work for everyone; </a> so our aim to get as many people involved so our Brigades are rich with all the different skills sets your entire community has to offer. Afterall, the members of your community are what will power your Brigade - so you should invite everyone to join! </p>
<p>So who is that exactly? Technologists, researchers, public policy enthusiasts, committed residents, city employees,  and everyone in between!</p>

<ol>
<li>You can ensure people's safety by implementing a Code of Conduct; <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct" target=_blank>fork this one!</a></li>	
<li>Next, build a website! Your Brigade needs a landing page so people can find you, plus you need a place where you can point to your Code of Conduct.</li>
<li>Your website can be something you build, can be a public Facebook or Meetup Account, or a page you fork using <a href="https://github.com/sfbrigade/sfbrigade.github.io" target=_blank>some base code Code for San Francisco made.</a></li>
<li>You can then use your website to advertise your event schedule...</li>
<li>Start meeting!  Find some space, head to the local library, ask your boss if you can use your office, etc. You should meet at least three times before you apply to become a Network Member, and hosting a CodeAcross or National Day event counts.  If you are an existing group with lots of meetings under your belt that  works, too.</li>
<li>As people start to show up to your meetings (which we call hack nights) you can help folks get more involved by offering <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oEB1CuzCHldxP_bzcvmcrmK0yAE1BzV2AGhtwtYKZVY/edit" target=_blank>Core Team Member roles</a> (the roles in this doc capture the big bucket to-dos of any Brigade, but you can hack the names and add more leadership roles to your squad).  Having Core Team Members helps you delegate responsibilities, and finally get some sleep.</li>
