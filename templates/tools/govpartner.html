<p>We have seen over and over that Brigades can be powerful forces for innovation and productive civic engagement in cities. A dedicated municipal partner is key for a Brigade to create deep and sustainable impact in its city.</p>

<p>This handbook is meant to give you, a city official who may be working with a Brigade chapter or is interested in helping to get one started in your city.</p>

<h2 id="what-brigades-do">1. What Brigades Do</h2>

	<h3>What is a Brigade</h3>
	<p>A Brigade is a local chapter of the Code for America Brigade network. The Code for America Brigade network is an international citizen volunteer program that creates new ways for residents to participate in building stronger local communities, in collaboration with government. </p>
	<p>A group can join the Code for America Brigade network as a Brigade Network Member or an Official Brigade Chapter.</p>
	<p><b>Brigade Network Member</b></p>
		<ul>
		<li>A Brigade Network Member is a local Brigade chapter committed to organizing people and participating in the Code for America Brigade network. </li>
		<li>Brigade Network Members have a leadership teams and hold consistent meetings (or “hack nights”).</li>
		<li>Brigade Network members have access to Code for America trainings and communication channels, allowing them learn and ask question alongside other leaders throughout the network. </li>
		<li>If interested, a Brigade Network Member can become an Official Brigade Chapter by working with municipal and community partners to draft and execute on a strategic plan that aligns with the Code for America Digital Government Principles.</li>
		</ul>
	<p><b>Official Brigade Chapter</b></p>
		<ul>
		<li>An Official Brigade Chapter is a local group committed to organizing people, participating in the Code for America Brigade network, and working with municipal and community partners to execute on a strategic plan that aligns with the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/" target=_blank>Code for America Digital Government Principles</a> and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/principles/engagement/" target=_blank>Citizen Engagement Standards.</a> </li>
		<li>Official Brigade Chapters have a leadership teams, a consistent hack night, a strategic plan, municipal partners, and community partners.</li>
		<li>Strategic plans allow Brigades to set yearly goals that align with the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/our-work/focus-areas/" target=_blank>Code for America Focus Areas</a>, and ensure their activities map to the improvement of their city offices.</li>
		<li>Community partners are other local non-profit organizations that align with Brigades in their mission, members, and activities.  Through strategic collaboration on events and projects, these partners can help expand the reach of Brigade activities and diversify their membership.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>As of October 2014, there are 50 Official Brigade Chapters and 92 Brigade Network Members. We are adding new chapters and members every week.</p>

	<h3>How do Brigades work?</h3>
	<p>A Brigade is an all-volunteer group that meets on a consistent basis (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) to work on projects and organize events to make their communities stronger using technology. A Brigade creates safe spaces where local government officials, residents, and representatives from community-based organizations build digital tools, advocate for open government policies, and create capacity for innovation in the community.</p>
	<p>Because Brigade members are volunteers, the projects a Brigade works on are subject to its members’ bandwidth and interest.</p>
	
	<h3>Who leads a Brigade?</h3>
	<p>Brigades are organized by a team of volunteer leaders that are responsible for core functions of the group. All of these local leaders are tied into a network of other leaders from around the world, with whom they share stories and lessons and draw on best practices from other chapters. </p>
	<p>The leadership team usually consists of: </p>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Executive Leadership:</b> All Brigades are led by Captains. The Captain(s) serves as the primary point of contact for city officials. In most cases, Brigades have two Captains and some have more. This redundancy reduces the risk that institutional knowledge will be lost if a Captain has to leave the Brigade.</li>
		<li><b>Storyteller:</b> The Brigade’s Storyteller is responsible for getting the word out about the Brigade, and documenting the work of their chapter. They oversee a group of volunteers who maintain the Brigade’s social media channels and web presence, write blog posts and other articles about Brigade activity, interface with local press, create marketing plans for projects and tools undertaken by the Brigade, and keep Code for America up to date about their activities. </li>
		<li><b>Delivery Lead:</b> The Brigade’s Delivery Lead is usually a technical person who is responsible for deploying the Brigade’s products. The Delivery Lead also plugs the Brigade into Code for America’s national tech infrastructure, keeps track of work that needs to be done on existing projects in order for them to be complete, and can assign new members to projects where their skillsets will be most useful.</li>
		<li><b>Community Organizer:</b> The Community Organizer is responsible for recruiting and onboarding new members, and for building relationships between the Brigade and other community organizations. </li>
		<li><b>Municipal Partners:</b> Official Brigade Chapters are required to have a Municipal Partner (maybe that’s you!) who serves as a full and equal member of the Brigade but also can serve as the conduit between the Brigade and the local government entities with which it works.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Brigade leadership roles are often filled by a team of people who distribute the responsibility amongst themselves. Some Brigades also have created custom leadership roles like Policy or Data Lead. Be sure to ask your local Brigade Captain(s) about their leadership structure.</p>	
	
	
<h2 id="what-partners-do">2. What Municipal Partners Do</h2>

	<p>A Municipal Partner is a member of a Brigade’s Leadership Team. They are the conduit between the Brigade and the local government entities they work with on projects and events. A Brigade can have more than one Municipal Partner.</p>
	<p>A Municipal Partner is responsible for:</p>
		<ul>
	<li>Championing the Brigade within local government</li>
	<li>Collaborating on Brigade projects</li>
	<li>Providing expertise on government processes and the feasibility of projects</li>
	<li>Helping source project ideas for the Brigade</li>	
		</ul>
	
	<p>Municipal Partners participate as leaders and stay connected to their Brigade in different ways. Some attend hack nights while others meet regularly with the Brigade Captains and leadership team outside of hack night. Before you take on the Municipal Partner role, it’s a good idea to have an open conversation with the Brigade leadership about their expectations, your bandwidth, and how you all prefer to communicate.</p>
	
	<h3>Can I participate in a Brigade if I’m not a Municipal Partner? </h3>
	<p>Yes! All government officials, regardless of whether they take on the formal role of the Municipal Partner, are encouraged to attend Brigade meetings and participate in projects</p>
	
	
	<h3>How important is a Municipal Partner to a Brigade’s success?</h3>
	<p>A dedicated Municipal Partner is so integral to the success of a Brigade that a group cannot become an Official Brigade Chapter until they have one. </p>
	<p>Municipal Partners are important because they have subject matter expertise about how local government works and can help Brigades with questions about city processes, department jurisdictions, and more. Municipal Partners also help ensure that the right folks from government are at the table when a Brigade starts a new project. This is key to the adoption and sustainability of a project.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-partner">3. How to Partner with Your Brigade</h2>

	<h3>How can I get up to speed on what’s happening in my Brigade?</h3>
	<p>Thinking of partnering with the Brigade in your city? Here are five questions to ask the Captains and leadership team to get up to speed:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>What is your Brigade’s leadership structure?</li>
		<li>Where, when, how often do you meet?</li>
		<li>What is your Brigade’s strategic plan for this year?</li>
		<li>What project or activity are you most looking forward to this year?</li>
		<li>My bandwidth for supporting the Brigade is X. What are some ways I could best support your Brigade given that bandwidth?</li>
		</ol>
	
	<h3>How can I plug into my Brigade’s meetings?</h3>
	<p>One of the best ways to get involved with your Brigade is to participate in their meetings, which many Brigades call “hack nights” or “meetups.” </p>
	<p>These meetings can be weekly, monthly, or quarterly. To find out when your local Brigade meets, check with the leadership team or find the Briagde at www.codeforamerica.org/brigade.</p>
	<p>There are a number of ways local government workers and Municipal Partners can plug into meetings, including:</p>
		<ol>
	<li>Provide insight into how local government works</li>
		a. Local government is complex! Providing insight into how it works is one of the most valuable things a Municipal Partner can do. <br>
		b. Some activities to help Brigade members better understand local gov include: <br>
			- Lead a monthly breakout session at hack night on how the government in your city, country, or state works. Providing an ongoing Local Gov 101 session will ensure new Brigade members know you’re there as a resource and will also help them get up to speed quickly.<br>
			- Hold office hours at hack night for Brigade members to come ask questions about local government.<br>
	<li>Connect Brigade members with your colleagues in local government and non-profits</li>
		a. It’s not always easy for Brigade members working on projects to identify who they should be talking to in local government or the community. Helping Brigade project leads connect with the right departments in government or non-profits in the community is integral to the success of a project. <br>
		b. Some activities to help Brigade members connect with local government and nonprofits include:<br>
			- Meet with each project lead at hack night to see if they have a local government and community partner. If they don’t, help connect them to the right folks.<br>
			- Ask your collegues in local government to come to hack night to participate in the Local Gov 101 breakout and connect with projects.<br>
	<li>Pitch a project idea or bring a dataset to hack night</li>
		a. See the next section “How can I bring a project to my Brigade?”<br>
	<li>Collaborate on a project that’s already gotten started</li>
		a. In addition to working on projects started in collaboration with local government or a non-profit, Brigade members often work on:<br>
			- Emergent projects where a project idea is generated by Brigade member.<br>
			- Redeployments where Brigades copy a project developed somewhere else and customize it for your city.<br>
		b. Check out what emergent or redeployment projects your Brigade is working on. You may be able to provide expertise, data, or connections.<br>
		</ol>
	
	<h3>How can I bring a project idea to my Brigade?</h3>
	<p>Have an idea for a project your Brigade might work on? That’s great! Here are five tips for pitching your idea at the next Brigade meeting:</p>
		<ol>
	<li>Ask the Brigade Captains the date of the next pitch session.</li>
	a. Many Brigades have a day or time set aside for folks to pitch new project ideas to the Brigade. This may be at the first meeting of the month or at the beginning of every meeting. Check with the Brigade Captains to see when the next pitch session is and ask if there are any guidelines for pitches (i.e. length of time to pitch, slides, etc).<br>
	<li>Come with a problem, not a solution.</li>
	a. Collaborating with others to find solutions to challenges is why Brigade members come out to volunteer. The best way to get folks to work with you on a project is to describe the problem you want to solve. People will be excited to work with you to find a solution. <br>
	<li>Make the problem easy to understand (or as easy to understand as possible):</li>
	a. It’s often helpful to have visuals, such as slides or a website, to direct folks to so they can better conceptualize the problem, process, etc. that you’re describing.<br>
	<li>If you have data, bring it.</li>
	a. A surefire way to get Brigade members interested in your project idea is to have a dataset for them to work with. <br>
	<li>If nobody volunteers this time, try again!</li>
	a. Sometimes Brigades members won’t have the bandwidth or skillset to work on your project when you pitch it. Don’t give up. Pitch your project at a future hack night. There may be new Brigade members who want to get involved or Brigade members with more bandwidth. <br>
	b. It’s always a good idea to ask the Brigade leadership team for feedback on your pitch so you can make it even better next time.<br>
		</ol>
	
	<h3>I love this, but I just don’t have the time to participate in person, what can I do?</h3>		
	<p>Participation comes in all shapes and sizes, but often just making it known you’re willing to be an information resource can be incredibly useful and a powerful way to build trust with people over time. You can reach out to a Brigade captain or municipal partner, and just let them know that you’re willing to field questions on particular subject areas.</p>
	<p>One of the jobs of Brigade leadership is to help connect volunteers to government and having your support can save countless hours tracking down answers. And, if you’re worried about getting too many inbound requests, just remember you can always manage those expectations and Brigade leadership should make efforts to respect your schedule.</p>
	
	<h3>What have Municipal Partners in other cities worked with their Brigades on?</h3>
	<p>Brigades around the world have worked with their Municipal Partners on a range of projects. </p>
	<p>Here are some examples:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Advice and advocacy around open-data policies and implementation plans </li>

<h2 id="faq">4. Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	
	<h3>What type of support does Code for America offer for Municipal Partners?</h3>
	<p>ADD TEXT</p>
	
	<h3>How can I help get a Brigade started in my city if there isn’t one already?</h3>
	<p>Don’t have a Brigade in your city but want to help get one started? That’s great!</p>
	<p>Here are three steps to help get a Brigade going in your city:</p>
		<ol>
	<li>Recruit a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oEB1CuzCHldxP_bzcvmcrmK0yAE1BzV2AGhtwtYKZVY/edit" target=_blank>Core Leadership Team.</a></li>
	<p>Brigades are organized by a team of volunteer leaders who are responsible for core functions of the group so a great first step to getting a Brigade off the ground is to start recruiting this core leadership team. To start recruiting:</p>
	a. Talk to your colleagues in local government about the Brigade to see if they have recommendations for people who might be interested/a good fit for a leadership role.
	b. Talk to leadership teams at local non-profits to see they have recommendations for people who might be interested/a good fit for a leadership role.
	c. Go out to local tech meetings to talk about the Brigade and why your city needs one. Not sure when/where local tech meetings happen? A good place to start is by going to meetup.com and searching for tech groups in your area.
	d. Email folks who are interested in leading a Brigade in your city with the links to www.codeforamerica.org/brigade and the Roles within a Local Brigade document so they can find out more information about what it means to lead a Brigade.
	<li>Host a planning meeting for the Core Leadership Team</li>
	a. Once you’ve recruited some folks interested in leading the Brigade, set up a meeting for everyone to get together.
	b. Some useful topics to cover at this meeting include:
	- Overview of what the Brigade is focused on
	- Discussion on the impact the Brigade could have in your city 
	- Discussion on how folks are interested in participating in the Brigade (see: Roles within a Local Brigade)
	<li>Commit to the role of Municipal Partner for your Brigade</li>
	a. A dedicated Municipal Partner is key for a Brigade to create deep and sustainable impact in it’s city. By stepping up as the Municipal Partner, you’ll help ensure the Brigade gets off to the right start.
		</ol>
	
	<h3>Is there a contract/MOU template for Municipal Partners and Brigades and/or Brigades and local government projects?</h3>	
	<p>Not currently, however here are some processes/policies to consider:</p>
		<ul>
	<li><b>Union Regulations.</b></li>
	<li><b>Maintenance.</b> Who is going to maintain what is developed? do you have staff who can and have the capacity and/or skill to maintain projects if they need to?</li>
	<li><b>Communications.</b> Are you working in tandem with your brigade to develop an engagement and marketing strategy?</li>
	<li><b>Data Retention.</b> Who owns data being collected and/or submitted through the applications and/or sites developed by the Brigade?</li>
	<li><b>ROI.</b>How is the project going to benefit the City and the community?</li>
		</ul>
