			<p class="attribute">What we’re doing is  tech-focused, but also social change work. If you want to build cool stuff, then do that, but opening government and providing technology that makes a difference for our communities means a lot of vulnerability and humility will be required...<br><br>... you'll get stuff wrong, make poor assumptions and build things that don't have all the success you'd like. But this all serves to grow you and your organization to do things better and may force you to listen and learn and refocus on things that matter.</p>

    <h2><center>How It All Began</center></h2>

    <p>In 2012, OpenOakland Co-Captains Spike and Eddie "chose each other as mentors" after meeting several times through their involvement in the Code for America civic tech network. They began collaborating to do work in the city they both love, Oakland, CA becuase they each believed strongly in the Code for America model for transforming government through localized organizing. At first, the OpenOakland Code for America Brigade started by hosting hackathons, which they found were good for building community, but unfortuantely not as good at building sustainable technology. While continuing to host larger events, they started also hosting regular meets to build upon the work initiatde at their hackathons. First they met monthly, but demand grew so they started meeting biweekly.  As of 2015, 20-40 hackers meet at OpenOakland weekly! <br> <br> OpenOakland members first began connecting at the Oakland Urban Strategies Council offices, but when <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/nicole-neditch/" target="_blank">Nicole Neiditch,</a> former Online Engagement Manager for the City of Oakland, now Code for America Fellowship Director, started to participate the Brigade was invited the to begin City Hall - the epicenter of all civic decision making for for their city. Having a weekly presence at City Hall has allowed the Brigade to forge more relationships with muncipal employees, althugh it can be challenging to recruite city employeed participants after work ours. they are working to find a balance of getting participation from city staff with meeting at a time that’s after work hours. 
    Even so, several city staff that regularly attend, including current City Online Engagement Manager, Mai-Ling Garcia. But even without a huge amount of city staff participation, OepnOakland has found that social awareness of their Brigade hack nights at City Hall is significantly buttressing support from local official. <br> <br>In late 2013, OpenOakland members asked Spike and Eddie how they could get more involved, and wondered about allowing for more leadership capacity so other volunteers could help take on the many exciting, but time consuming, opportunities presented to the group. Choosing participants who consistently engaged, OpenOakland formed a Core Membership Team of approximately 20 volunteers.  Together they are working on new initiatives like the Civic User Testing Group, and doing more local fundraising.<br> <br> </p>

As OpenOakland looks to the future, they would like to increase application development as well as engaging communities, design thinking and user testing. Currently, an organization can come to them with a project for consideration, OpenOakland can work on it as well as connect with other organizations to produce the best solution that has a bigger impact as well as builds more community trust.

	<h2><center>OpenDisclosure</center></h2>
	<h3><center>Telling Stories with Data</center></h3>
	<P>
	To build their relationship with the city, OpenOakland knew that creating quick wins was important. Growing out of a hackathon project to visualize the city’s budget data, OpenOakland helped create <a href="http://openbudgetoakland.org/">Open Budget Oakland</a> to help councilmembers and residents better understand the budget. Before budget time, the Open Budget Oakland team pushed the city to release raw data for the first time.</p>

	</section>
	
	<p> In the same vein, the team later built </p><a href="http://www.opendisclosure.io/" target="_blank"><font color="black">Open Disclosure,</font></a> a web application that brings transparency to campaign financing. <br><br>
 	In 2014, OpenOakland partnered with the Oakland <a href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/CityAdministration/d/PublicEthics/index.htm" target="_blank"><font color="black">Public Ethics Commission</font></a>  to ensure accurate data of the 2014 
	Oakland Mayoral election was available and ask key questions such as,  “who are the top campaign contributors?” and “what percentage of campaign contributions to each mayoral candidate 
	are made from Oakland residents vs. others?” <br><br>

	The team used <a href="https://github.com/openoakland/opendisclosure/issues" target="_blank"><font color="black">Github</font></a> for sharing code and having conversations about the data and questions. They work mostly in two teams, 
	one building the front end visualizations in D3, which they are teaching themselves, and a back-end process team 
	figuring out how to streamline getting the data into an open format.

  <h2>Within City Halls</h2>
</section>  
  
   <p> As OpenOakland moved into City Hall for weekly meetings, they have continued to make more influence and impact on local governance. One of the biggest champions for working with themhas been the Public Ethics Commission, who have found OpenOakland to be allies and collaborators on projects where the city lacks internal capacity, such as Open Disclosure, which visualizes campaign finance data. The team from OpenOakland, working directly with city staff, helped streamline the data publishing into an open format, and also worked with the commission on key questions to answer via the data as well as taught themselves d3 to create visualizations. OpenOakland has also helped create a bridge between Oakland and San Francisco City Hall, whose their IT staff were already working on and publishing similar data.

Oakland’s Code for America fellows in 2013 helped to improve internal digital literacy within City Hall and began breaking through some of the internal barriers through tutorials and brown bag lunches. The fellows were also created a new tool, RecordTrac, to help the city openly manage freedom of information requests. Oakland is now touted as a model for other cities to follow as they update their records requests systems and processes. 

Co-captain Eddie Tejeda was appointed Vice Chair of the Public Ethics Commission, and is a strong voice for the role data and technology plays in transparency. The Commission recently released their report,  “Toward Collaborative Transparency” which has several items directly inspired by OpenOakland:a Transparency Fellowship to allow residents to work across city departments and a Technology Commission to provide advice and recommendations to the city. As part of Sunshine Week 2014 and with OpenOakland member Klein Lieu, the Public Ethics Commission started a blog to share campaign requirements and pull in other articles that inform candidates and city staff. Additional OpenOakland members have been appointed to commissions as well, including Ellie Casson on the Planning Commission and Adam Stiles on the Budget Committee.

  <h2>“OpenOakland is not just there to fill gaps in city IT capacity, but helps show value and gives internal leverage for funding and hiring.” <br><br> Whitney Barazoto, Executive Director of the Oakland Public Ethics Commission. </h2>
</section>  

The City is trying to maneuver in a respectful way with OpenOakland participants that doesn’t abuse that they are volunteers. By working with city staff, members of OpenOakland are getting to see first hand some of the constraints of city staff, and creating empathy to help bring about change. In return, the city is now asking new questions as they start new projects, such as how to include open data, take a more user-centric approach, and see where collaboration can happen.
