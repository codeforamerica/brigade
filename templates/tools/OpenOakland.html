<h2 id="how-it-all-began">1. How it all Began</h2>

 <p>In 2012, OpenOakland Co-Captains Spike and Eddie "chose each other as mentors" after meeting several times through their involvement in the Code for America civic tech network. They began collaborating to do work in the city they both love, Oakland, CA becuase they each believed strongly in the Code for America model for transforming government through localized organizing.</p> 
 <p>At first, the OpenOakland Code for America Brigade started by hosting hackathons, which they found were good for building community, but unfortuantely not as good at building sustainable technology. While continuing to host larger events, they started also hosting regular meets to build upon the work initiatde at their hackathons. First they met monthly, but demand grew so they started meeting biweekly.  As of 2015, 20-40 hackers meet at OpenOakland weekly! OpenOakland members first began connecting at the Oakland Urban Strategies Council offices, but when <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/people/nicole-neditch/" target="_blank">Nicole Neiditch,</a> former Online Engagement Manager for the City of Oakland, now Code for America Fellowship Director, started to participate the Brigade was invited the to begin City Hall - the epicenter of all civic decision making for for their city. Having a weekly presence at City Hall has allowed the Brigade to forge more relationships with muncipal employees, althugh it can be challenging to recruite city employeed participants after work ours. they are working to find a balance of getting participation from city staff with meeting at a time that’s after work hours. Even so, several city staff that regularly attend, including current City Online Engagement Manager, Mai-Ling Garcia. But even without a huge amount of city staff participation, OepnOakland has found that social awareness of their Brigade hack nights at City Hall is significantly buttressing support from local official.</p>
 <p>In late 2013, OpenOakland members asked Spike and Eddie how they could get more involved, and wondered about allowing for more leadership capacity so other volunteers could help take on the many exciting, but time consuming, opportunities presented to the group. Choosing participants who consistently engaged, OpenOakland formed a Core Membership Team of approximately 20 volunteers.  Together they are working on new initiatives like the Civic User Testing Group, and doing more local fundraising.<br> <br> </p>

  <p>As OpenOakland looks to the future, they would like to increase application development as well as engaging communities, design thinking and user testing. Currently, an organization can come to them with a project for consideration, OpenOakland can work on it as well as connect with other organizations to produce the best solution that has a bigger impact as well as builds more community trust.</p>

			<p class="attribute">What we’re doing is  tech-focused, but also social change work. If you want to build cool stuff, then do that, but opening government and providing technology that makes a difference for our communities means a lot of vulnerability and humility will be required...<br><br>... you'll get stuff wrong, make poor assumptions and build things that don't have all the success you'd like. But this all serves to grow you and your organization to do things better and may force you to listen and learn and refocus on things that matter.</p></p>

<h2 id="open-disclosure">3. OpenDisclosure: Telling Stories with Data</h2>

	<p>To build their relationship with the city, OpenOakland knew that creating quick wins was important. Growing out of a hackathon project to visualize the city’s budget data, OpenOakland helped create <a href="http://openbudgetoakland.org/">Open Budget Oakland</a> to help councilmembers and residents better understand the budget. Before budget time, the Open Budget Oakland team pushed the city to release raw data for the first time.</p>	

	<section class="layout-semibreve layout-centered intro">
	<a href="http://www.opendisclosure.io/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/static/images/casestudies/opendisclosure.png" height="300" width="600"/></a>
	</section>
	
	<p>In the same vein, the team later built <a href="http://www.opendisclosure.io/" target="_blank"><font color="black">Open Disclosure,</font></a> a web application that brings transparency to campaign financing.</p>
 	
 	
 	</p>In 2014, OpenOakland partnered with the Oakland <a href="http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/CityAdministration/d/PublicEthics/index.htm" target="_blank"><font color="black">Public Ethics Commission</font></a>  to ensure accurate data of the 2014 
	Oakland Mayoral election was available and ask key questions such as,  “who are the top campaign contributors?” and “what percentage of campaign contributions to each mayoral candidate 
	are made from Oakland residents vs. others?” </p>

	<p>The team used <a href="https://github.com/openoakland/opendisclosure/issues" target="_blank"><font color="black">Github</font></a> for sharing code and having conversations about the data and questions. They work mostly in two teams, 
	one building the front end visualizations in D3, which they are teaching themselves, and a back-end process team 
	figuring out how to streamline getting the data into an open format. </p>

<h2 id="build-small-things-quickly">4. Build small things quickly</h2>

<p>Digital services must be built using agile development and user-centered design. They must be frequently tested with real users in as realistic of environments as possible.  Working this way gets software into real users’ hands quickly, allowing for more time to see what features need to be added, removed or fixed. Testing in real  environments provide context for measuring the service’s overall experience. Working iteratively - making lots of small changes, often - also reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely, and helps turn small failures into lessons that can be learned by everyone.</p>

<h3 id="checklist-3">Checklist:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Projects begin with a prototype that is intended to be thrown away after testing.</li>
  <li>Requirements are expressed in terms of user needs.</li>
  <li>Refinements are based on feedback from real users and incorporated into future releases.</li>
  <li>Releases are frequent, and small. Failures are corrected by quick fixes rather than rollbacks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="establish-performance-benchmarks">5. Establish performance benchmarks</h2>

<p>Measuring your service’s performance will highlight how to better meet your users’ needs. Your metrics must measure the success of your service, and should be based on an understanding of user and stakeholder needs. These metrics should be simple, easy to collect and, ultimately, help tell a story about how to improve your service and know it is meeting user needs. You should use analytic tools to measure what is happening, but also conduct qualitative interviews to understand why users behave a certain way when using a service.</p>

<h3 id="checklist-4">Checklist:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Metrics are in place to indicate how well the service is working for its users.</li>
  <li>The digital service measures customer satisfaction.</li>
  <li>A target completion rate for users has been established, and the service is modified to help the service reach this target.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="establish-a-service-governance-plan-that-incorporates-user-feedback">6. Establish a service governance plan that incorporates user feedback</h2>

<p>After a service is live, the work is not done. A digital service must continuously be improved in response to user needs and react to new demands as they emerge. Plan for ongoing user research and usability testing to continuously test assumptions and provide sustainability to the service.</p>

<h3 id="checklist-5">Checklist:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>During each stage of usability testing, gaps are identified in addressing user needs and then refined through additional development.</li>
  <li>Determine who will be responsible for on-going maintenance of your service.</li>
</ul>
